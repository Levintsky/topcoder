Tianbing’s Weekly Report

11/16 
1. Implemented full batch TRPO with parametric stein inference, the policy is generated from mean network and variance network. 
2. Reproduced PPO baselines results. The baselines results (e.g. HumanoidStandup) are pretty good.

TODO 
1. One possible further work is to design and use multi-model action distribution represented by policy network 
2. Another possible work is to think about how to sample parameters efficiently from variational posterior distributions

11/9 
1. Implemented mini-batch TRPO with our variational inference

11/2 
1. Do theoretical derivations and arrive at concrete algorithms 
2. implemented policy gradient by stochastic variational inference 
3. The motivation to derive our variational inference is to investigate the possible exploration effects and other potential impacts on the general RL problems

todo 
implementing TRPO with our own stochastic variational inference
