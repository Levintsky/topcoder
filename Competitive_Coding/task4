Separate Conditional Zero-Shot Learning problem to Zero-Shot Learning problem and Compositionality problem.
Zero-Shot Learning with Transfer
1000 steps of training for all methods. Logit of missing label is set constant.

Method	All	Normal	Missing
Baseline	68.41%	100.00%	6.64%
Offline	61.48%	75.77%	33.54%
Upperbound	100.00%	100.00%	100.00%
Accuracies for All (all test data), Normal (same distribution as training) and Missing (data with new label).

Compositionality
1000 steps of training for all methods. Logit mask network is used for online and offline methods. For offline method, 100 steps for pretraining. For online method, negarive model is updated only once per minibatch.

Method	All	Normal	Missing
Baseline	88.90%	100.00%	0.00%
L1	88.90%	100.00%	0.00%
L2	88.90%	100.00%	0.00%
Offline	96.53%	100.00%	68.74%
Online	88.90%	100.00%	0.00%
Upperbound	100.00%	100.00%	100.00%

Implement data generation and transfer learning pipeline.
Experiment with Baseline and UpperBound.
Continue write up.
11/02/2017

Experiment on image based tasks for Conditional Zero-Shot Prediction in Transfer Learning. Using grid setup, but it each grid contains a RGB image.
Continue to write paper, with discussions with colleagues.
Make explanatory images and diagrams for the algorithm.
Will continue experiment and write up.
Update implementation diagram for Reinforcement Learning. (link)
