Weekly Report - Haichao Zhang

11/09-11/16

Results

~ 90% success rate under sentence based setting for novel concepts, comparable to previous word-based setting
experiment setting 
random session with at most two objects involved in each session
“what”-type of questions, sentence based answers
no visual appearance variations
Approaches

attention-based word selection from sentence (same as last week)
fusion gate conditioned on both rnn-state and knowledge confidence (different from last week)
beam size 3 (different from last week, which is 1)
Next

increase variations: dialogue (questions, [increase] answers [increase], statements[add]), visual appearances [add]
investigate the role of RL in training
further extension
11/02-11/09

Results

working towards sentence based setting: attention based word selection is implemented
encountered side effects on the memory update gate, working on the reasons
also investigating the impact of memory write/read order on the final performance using the single word answer as the test setting
Next

continue to work on sentence based answers
10/26-11/02

Results

achieve ~90% success rate on novel test set (previously ~60%) under the following setting
setting: random session (objects are presented in a random order within a session), single form of questions, single word answering (+ EOS)
Approach

add an memory update gate for determining whether a concept should be remembered/stored or not
use additive noise + schedule layer based sharpening to progressively making the gate output close to binary
Next

analysis and better understanding of the current model
add more variations to questions
extend to sentence based answers
10/19-10/26

Results

Add learner’s previous response as input for next time step to make the language model leverage the alternating conversational sentences between teacher and learner
Improved the generalization ability of the model over novel concepts by adjusting the model structure
Next

Work on external memory which has a more adaptive way to write/store learned concepts
