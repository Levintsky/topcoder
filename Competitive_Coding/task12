11.9 - 11.15

Main Progress

Add a background noise estimation layer to remove the random background cluttered noise to estimate better motion for robot arms, looks slightly better

11.3 - 11.9

Main Progress

Train a baseline method on KITTI with 128x128 resolution, the motion range on KITTI is very large, i.e. max flow 28 pixels, current model motion range is not able to capture such large motion.

10.30 - 11.3

Main Progress

Try training with noise augmentation to solve motion noisy problem but does not work yet
Use gradient as loss, qualitative results look slightly better
Train with 4000 steps instead of 2000 steps, qualitative results looks better
Replace softmax function with sigmoid function on motion kernel estimation, qualitative results look better
Download Kitti dataset

Next Step

Will setup Kitti dataset for quantitative measure
