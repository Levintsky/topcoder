Progress and Result

resubmit the occlusion optical flow paper to CVPR and arXiv
Fitted a lossNet for learning a loss metric from g.t. flow
Trained the our flow estimation network using the learned metric but got worse result
Next step

Change the loss for lossNet in pixel level to avoid overfitting

Progress and Result

Calculate the unsupervised loss of the result of flownet2, and it has higher loss than our result on 1/4 size but lower loss on full-size image
Trained our model with loss on the full-size which reduces the full-size loss, but got worse epe error.
It’s better to use resize_area to down-sample image, and use resize_bicubic to upsample image. See http://tanbakuchi.com/posts/comparison-of-openv-interpolation-algorithms/

Progress and Result

Found out that reducing the smoothness penalty did not lower the photometric error (which is higher than ground truth), I suspect that my model capacity is not enough. Tuning my extra warped-input network structure did not help. So tried PWC-net
Implemented PWC-net with unsupervised objective
PWC net gives a similar EPE with my current network structure with 1/10 number of parameters but similar training time
Interesting training curve and found a different local minimum
Next Step

Use enlarged warping technique with image-grad as the goal
