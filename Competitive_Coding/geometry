 Jarvis's Algorithm for Wrapping

 1) Initialize p as leftmost point.
 2) Do following while we donâ€™t come back to the first (or leftmost) point.
   a) The next point q is the point such that the triplet (p, q, r) is counterclockwise for any other point r.
   b) next[p] = q (Store q as next of p in the output convex hull).
   c) p = q (Set p as q for next iteration).
 Time complexity: O(m * n)
   m: convex points
