Notice!
binary, hex, ...: how to handle negative case

hash table, list, min, max problems: duplicates!
414

Anytime, look up nearest sth. think of binary-search!!!
475, random sample

Stack in python: implemented by list

---------------------
double pointer / double direction:
238

priority queue:
378 (generally with a heap)

bit operation:
371

bfs, dfs:
332: Euler graph

dp:
260
264
309: insight of two dp record keeping

algorithm:
240: search order
287
400

tree:
230: in-order traversal must record visited! otherwise, a while loop to push all left inside while
then, only push right in the outer loop
310: think carefully about the optimim solution
437

hash_table:
220, 274: idea of bucket-sort
447

string:
179, 459

stack:
496, 173

trie:
208

logic:
223

system:
380: random set with O(1) insert, delete and get_random
535
284: iterator

geometry:
391: perfect square (think from corner points)
587: convex hull algorithm
