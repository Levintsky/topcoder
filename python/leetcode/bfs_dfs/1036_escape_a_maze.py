"""
1036. Escape a Large Maze (Hard)

In a 1 million by 1 million grid, the coordinates of each grid square are (x, y) with 0 <= x, y < 10^6.

We start at the source square and want to reach the target square.  Each move, we can walk to a 4-directionally adjacent square in the grid that isn't in the given list of blocked squares.

Return true if and only if it is possible to reach the target square through a sequence of moves.

Example 1:

Input: blocked = [[0,1],[1,0]], source = [0,0], target = [0,2]
Output: false
Explanation: 
The target square is inaccessible starting from the source square, because we can't walk outside the grid.

Example 2:

Input: blocked = [], source = [0,0], target = [999999,999999]
Output: true
Explanation: 
Because there are no blocked cells, it's possible to reach the target square.

Note:

0 <= blocked.length <= 200
blocked[i].length == 2
0 <= blocked[i][j] < 10^6
source.length == target.length == 2
0 <= source[i][j], target[i][j] < 10^6
source != target
