"""
1004. Max Consecutive Ones III (Medium)

Given an array A of 0s and 1s, we may change up to K values from 0 to 1.

Return the length of the longest (contiguous) subarray that contains only 1s. 

Example 1:

Input: A = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], K = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: 
[1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1.  The longest subarray is underlined.
Example 2:

Input: A = [0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1], K = 3
Output: 10
Explanation: 
[0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1.  The longest subarray is underlined.

Note:

1 <= A.length <= 20000
0 <= K <= A.length
A[i] is 0 or 1

solution 2: optimization
don't need to update i, since we want to get max
