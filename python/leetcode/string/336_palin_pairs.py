336. Palindrome Pairs (Hard)

Given a list of unique words, find all pairs of distinct indices (i, j) in the given list, so that the concatenation of the two words, i.e. words[i] + words[j] is a palindrome.

Example 1:
Given words = ["bat", "tab", "cat"]
Return [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
The palindromes are ["battab", "tabbat"]
Example 2:
Given words = ["abcd", "dcba", "lls", "s", "sssll"]
Return [[0, 1], [1, 0], [3, 2], [2, 4]]
The palindromes are ["dcbaabcd", "abcddcba", "slls", "llssssll"]

Apparently there is an O(n^2 * k) naive solution for this problem, with n the total number of words in the words array and k the average length of each word: for each word, we simply go through the words array and check whether the concatenated string is a palindrome or not.

Of course this will result in TLE, as expected. To improve the algorithm, we want to reduce the number of words that need to be checked for each word, instead of iterating through the whole array. This prompted me to think if I can extract any useful information out of the process checking whether the concatenated string is a palindrome, so that it can help eliminate as many words as possible for the rest of the words array.

To begin, here is the technique I employed to check for palindromes: maintain two pointers i and j, with i pointing to the start of the string and j to the end of the string. Characters pointed by i and j are compared. If at any time the characters pointed by them are not the same, we conclude the string is not a palindrome. Otherwise we move the two pointers towards each other until they meet in the middle and the string is a palindrome.

By examining the process above, I did find something that we may take advantage of to get rid of words that need to be checked otherwise. For example, let's say we want to append words to w0, which starts with character 'a'. Then we only need to consider words ending with character 'a', i.e., this will single out all words ending with character 'a'. If the second character of w0 is 'b', for instance, we can further reduce our candidate set to words ending with string "ba", etc. Our naive solution throws away all these useful pieces of information and repeats the comparison, which leads to the undesired O(n^2 * k) time complexity.

In order to exploit the information gathered so far, we obviously need to restructure all the words in the words array. If you are familiar with Trie structure (I believe you are, since LeetCode has problems for it. In case you are not, see Trie), it will come to mind as we need to deal with words with common suffixes. The next step is to design the structure for each Trie node. There are at least two fields that should be covered for each TrieNode: a TrieNode array denoting the next layer of nodes and a boolean (or integer) to signify the end of a word. So our tentative TrieNode will look like this:

class TrieNode {
    TrieNode[] next;
    boolean isWord;
}
One point here is that we assume all the words contain lowercase letters only. This is not specified in the problem statement so you probably need to confirm with the interviewer (here I assume it is the case).

Now we will rearrange each word into this Trie structure: for each word, simply starting from its last character and identify the node at the next layer by indexing into root's next array with index given by the difference between the ending character and character 'a'. If the indexed node is null, create a new node. Continue to the next layer and towards the beginning of the word in this manner until we are done with the word, at which point we will label the isWord field of the final node as true.

After building up the Trie structure, we can proceed to search for pairs of palindromes for each word in the words array. I will use the following example to explain how it works and make possible modifications of the TrieNode we proposed above.

Let's say we have these words: ["ba", "a", "aaa"], the Trie structure will be as follows:

        root (f)
           | 'a'
          n1 (t)
     ------------
 'b' |          | 'a'
    n2 (t)    n3 (f)
                | 'a'
              n4 (t)
The letter in parentheses indicates the value of isWord for each node: f ==> false and t ==> true. The letter beside each vertical line denotes the index into the next array of the corresponding node. For example, for the first vertical line, 'a' means root.next[0] is not null. Similarly 'b' means n1.next[1] is not null, and so on.

Here is the searching process:

For word "ba", starting from the first character 'b', index into the root.next array with index given by 'b' - 'a' = 1. The corresponding node is null, then we know there are no words ending at this character, so the searching process is terminated;
For word "a", again indexing into array root.next at index given by 'a' - 'a' = 0 will yield node n1, which is not null. We then check the value of n1.isWord. If it is true, then it is possible to obtain a palindrome by appending this word to the one currently being examined (a.k.a word "a"). Also note that the two words should be distinct from each other, but the n1.isWord field provides no information about the word itself, which makes it impossible to distinguish the two words. So it is necessary to modify the structure of the TrieNode so that we can identify the word it represents. One easy way is to have an integer field to remember the index of the word in the words array. For non-word nodes, this integer will take negative values (-1 for example) while for those representing a word, it will be non-negative values. Suppose we have made this modification, then the two words will be identified to be the same, so we discard this pair combination. Since the word "a" has only one letter, it seems we are done with it. Or do we? Not really. What if there are words with suffix "a" ("aaa" in this case)? We need to continue to check the rest part of these words (such as "aa" for the word "aaa") and see if the rest forms a palindrome. If it is, then appending this word ("aaa" in this case) to the original word ("a") will also form a palindrome ("aaaa"). Here I take another strategy: add an integer list to each TrieNode; the list will record the indices of all words satisfying the following two conditions: 1. each word has a suffix represented by the current TrieNode; 2. the rest of the word forms a palindrome.
Before I get to the third word "aaa", let me spell out the new TrieNode and the corresponding Trie structure for the above array.

TrieNode:

class TrieNode {
    TrieNode[] next;
    int index;
    List<Integer> list;
            
    TrieNode() {
        next = new TrieNode[26];
        index = -1;
        list = new ArrayList<>();
    }
}
Trie:

          root (-1,[1,2])
            | 'a'
          n1 (1,[0,1,2])
    ---------------------
'b' |                 | 'a'
  n2 (0,[0])    n3 (-1,[2])
                      | 'a'
                 n4 (2,[2])
The first integer in the parentheses is the index of the word in the words" array (defaulted to -1). The integers in the square bracket are the indices of words satisfying the two conditions mentioned above.

Let's continue with the third word "aaa" with this new structure. Indexing into array root.next at index given by 'a' - 'a' = 0 will yield node n1 and n1.index = 1 >= 0, which means we have a valid word now. The index of this word (which is 1) is also different from the index of the word currently being visited, a.k.a "aaa" (which is 2). So pair (2,1) is a possible concatenation to form a palindrome. But still we need to check the rest of "aaa" (excluding the substring represented by current node n1 which is "a" from the beginning of "aaa") to see if it is a palindrome. If so, (2,1) will be a valid combination. We continue in this fashion until we reach the end of "aaa". Lastly we will check n4.list to see if there are any words satisfying the two conditions specified in step 2 which are different from current word, and add the corresponding valid pairs.

Both building and searching the Trie structure take O(n * k^2), which sets the total time complexity of the solution. Here is the complete Java program:

private static class TrieNode {
    TrieNode[] next;
    int index;
    List<Integer> list;
      
    TrieNode() {
      next = new TrieNode[26];
      index = -1;
      list = new ArrayList<>();
    }
}
    
public List<List<Integer>> palindromePairs(String[] words) {
    List<List<Integer>> res = new ArrayList<>();

    TrieNode root = new TrieNode();
    
    for (int i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {
        addWord(root, words[i], i);
    }
    
    for (int i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {
        search(words, i, root, res);
    }
    
    return res;
}
    
private void addWord(TrieNode root, String word, int index) {
    for (int i = word.length() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        int j = word.charAt(i) - 'a';
        
        if (root.next[j] == null) {
            root.next[j] = new TrieNode();
        }
        
        if (isPalindrome(word, 0, i)) {
            root.list.add(index);
        }
        
        root = root.next[j];
    }
      
    root.list.add(index);
    root.index = index;
}
    
private void search(String[] words, int i, TrieNode root, List<List<Integer>> res) {
    for (int j = 0; j < words[i].length(); j++) { 
      if (root.index >= 0 && root.index != i && isPalindrome(words[i], j, words[i].length() - 1)) {
          res.add(Arrays.asList(i, root.index));
      }
        
      root = root.next[words[i].charAt(j) - 'a'];
        if (root == null) return;
    }
      
    for (int j : root.list) {
      if (i == j) continue;
      res.add(Arrays.asList(i, j));
    }
}
    
private boolean isPalindrome(String word, int i, int j) {
    while (i < j) {
      if (word.charAt(i++) != word.charAt(j--)) return false;
    }
      
    return true;
}
We have the TrieNode structure at the top. In the palindromePairs function, we build up the Trie by adding each word, then search for valid pairs for each word and record the results in the res list. The last isPalindrome function checks if the substring [i, j] (both inclusive) of the given word is a palindrome.

Hope this helps and happy coding!
